## DevOpsSustain 2026

### Call for Paper
Information and communication technologies (ICT) are causing ever-growing energy consumption and carbon emissions. Software is at the center of ICT, from large-scale data centers to personal devices. Thus, improving the energy efficiency of the software is critical for reducing the energy footprint of ICT and contributing to sustainable development. DevOps has become the main principle for developing and operating modern software systems, which aims to enhance the velocity of releasing high-quality software through automation and integrating development and operations responsibilities. On the one hand, the fast DevOps release cycles pose significant challenges for ensuring the energy efficiency of software and its deployment environment. On the other hand, DevOps provides great opportunities for enhancing software sustainability, since the integration between development and operations allows for continuous collection and analytics of energy consumption data, which can be leveraged as feedback for optimizing the energy efficiency of software and its deployment environment.

The International Workshop on DevOps for Sustainability (DevOpsSustain) provides a platform for researchers and practitioners to discuss topics related to the challenges and opportunities in the interplay of DevOps and sustainability. 

This workshop edition will explore topics related to:

- Energy measurement, profiling, and monitoring
- Testing for energy efficiency
- Energy optimization in software deployment
- Energy consumption modeling/characterization
- Energy considerations software development lifecycles
- Energy-aware operations and deployment
- Energy benchmarking
- AI for software sustainability
- Energy anomaly detection and root cause diagnosis
- Empirical studies on software energy consumption
- Energy consumption of AI-based or data-centric systems
- Industry reports on sustainable development and operations


### Submission

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished papers that are not being considered in any other venue.

We accept three types of submissions, as described below. The page limits include references.

- Technical Research/Experience Papers (long papers, up to 10 pages): This track is defined for papers that report innovative research or significant experiences that are closely aligned with the themes of the workshop.

- Ideas, Visions, Reflections, or Working-in-Progress Papers (short papers, up to 4 pages): This track is defined for the submissions that propose radical and innovative ideas, pioneering research directions, provide insightful reflections and lessons from past experiences, or discuss early results of significant research.

- Extended Abstract (for presentations only, up to 2 pages): This track is defined for demos or industry presentations. This track will not be included in the ACM digital library.

The accepted papers will be included in the FSE companion proceedings to be published in the ACM digital library. As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all [ACM Publications Policies](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/toc), including [ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects). At least one author of each accepted paper must register and present the paper in person at the workshop to have the paper appear in the FSE companion proceedings.

Papers should follow the ACM format required by FSE 2026. Please note that the workshop papers must use the double-column format required by the Companion proceedings. Papers should be submitted via the [HotCRP submission site](https://hotcrp.com).

In order to ensure the fairness of the reviewing process, the workshop will employ a double-anonymous review process where reviewers (except PC chairs) do not know the identity of authors, and authors do not know the identity of reviewers. The papers submitted must not reveal the authors’ identities in any way. Please find more details about the double-anonymous review process here.

If you use LaTeX, please use ``\documentclass[sigconf,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}``.
